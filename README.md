# T.S. Foster's Dotfiles

I am in the process of moving my old dotfiles directory (which was at one point lean and organised) to a new setup, hopefully not embarrassing enough to be public instead of private.

## Requirements

My dotfiles do not (yet) check for the existence of any of these, it just assumes them to be installed.

* Git 1.7.10+
* Exuberant Ctags 5.8+
* tmux 1.9+
* Powerline beta (installed in /usr/local/bin)

## Installation

Check requirements are met, clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/TSFoster/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles` and run `~/.dotfiles/bin/refresh_dotfiles`.
