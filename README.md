# T.S. Foster's Dotfiles

I am in the process of moving my old dotfiles directory (which was at one point lean and organised) to a new setup, hopefully not embarrassing enough to be public instead of private.

## Requirements

**TBD**. At least git, nvim, pyenv, rbenv, node, zsh

## Installation

Check requirements are met, clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/TSFoster/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles` and run `~/.dotfiles/bin/install_dotfiles`.

For the italic fonts (see the `italic-fonts` directory), make sure you have an italic font installed (I recommend [Triplicate]), and follow the instructions on [Alex Pearce]'s website.
