# T.S. Foster's Dotfiles

I am in the process of moving my old dotfiles directory (which was at one point lean and organised) to a new setup, hopefully not embarrassing enough to be public instead of private.

## Requirements

* Git 1.7.10 or later
* Exuberant Ctags (5.8 or later?)

## Installation

Check requirements, clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/TSFoster/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles` and run `~/.dotfiles/bin/refresh_dotfiles`.
